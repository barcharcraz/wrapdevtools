# Contributing to wrap dev tools

Wrap dev tools is meant to be a collaboration between maintainers of
meson wraps to make all our lives easier. While this involves some
code, it also involves documentation, common conventions, and
communication. We are happy to both review and accept your
contributions, and to help you if you're interested in contributing
and need some pointers.
